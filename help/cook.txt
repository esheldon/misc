chili powder
==============

2 tablespoons paprika
2 teaspoons oregano
1 1/4 teaspoons cumin
1 1/4 teaspoons garlic powder
1 1/4 teaspoons cayenne pepper
3/4 teaspoon onion powder

I put 1 tsp cayenne in because I cooked with jalepenos.
I added extra cumin and garlic powder.
I added some ancho chili powder

===================

Shooter Ricks Snakebite Chicken Rub 

If you brine, should probably cut back the salt considerably

3/4 cup raw sugar
1/4 cup sea salt
1tbs red pepper flakes
1tbs garlic powder
1tbs onion powder
1tbs Hungarian Paprika
2 tsp all spice
1 tsp black pepper course
1 tsp oregano
1 tsp thyme
1 tsp Wasabi powder
1 tsp cumin

Don't completely go crazy with the rub; just coat everything.

I tried without skin, worked pretty good.  But I think I should aim for 270 or
so for temp.

Pulled the breasts at 155 and they were done!!  Something wierd with my
thermometers?

Probably should wet them with an apple spray to help keep outside from getting
rubbery.  I did mop them with the rub mixed into oil, but might not have helped.

ribs
=========

I halved this for a single rack. next time add cinnamon to this.  Sarah
thought slightly too much sugar (not me), but would have been offset had I
used more smoke I think.

1 cup brown sugar
1/2 cup paprika
2 1/2 tablespoons ground black pepper
2 1/2 tablespoons salt
1 tablespoon mustard powder
1 1/2 tablespoon cayenne
1 1/2 tablespoon chili powder
1 1/2 tablespoon garlic powder
1 1/2 tablespoon onion powder

3-2-1
------------

- don't forget to regularly spray with juice whenever the ribs are on the rack
- apply mustard before the rub
- remove membrane

    - 3 hours of smoke
    - 2 hours wrapped in foil with some juice in there
    - 1 hour out of foil; put on sauce if you have it

Wine went  well:  Dry riesling (Chateah St. Michelle, Columbia valley 2011)

The wood

    misquite.  This was excellent

The Rub

    Just a lot of sea salt (from grinder) black pepper (from grinder)
    and garlic powder.  Very similar to how I do burgers.   It was
    excellent

The plan
    
    Cook right on grill until the stall at about ~150-160, take it off
    and wrap in foil until 190-195, take back out and finish it on
    the grill till 205.

    Two smoke boxes of chips at the biginning and another at the end.

What happened

    took it out of wrap at at 190, but it then dropped to 163!  It did
    get a good smoking at this time and probably improved the bark,but it was
    in the stall.  I decided to re-wrap and took it all the way to 205.

    It turned out delicious!  It was a bit dry in the middle but parts of
    it were amazing.

next time

    Good but not great.  I put in foil at 155 or so and took it all the way to
    205.  It *seemed* to be stalling  at 155.  Took about 6.5 hours.  It was
    not falling apart yummy.  The meat was not that marbled for one, but I I'm
    not sure going so quickly was a good thing.    Maybe should have ttried
    to get it to 165 before wrapping.
        
        - could do it exactly the same!  But if the dryness in certain parts
        was because of my errors then this is not a good idea.  But who knows?


dry seasoning mix for buckwheat + pig meat
--------------------------------------------

1 cup buckwheat, on can meat

first try, it was pretty good but needed
something different

I actually doubled this, and had a bit more paprika
which I didn't like
1 tblsp powdered onion
1/2 tblsp paprika
1 tsp powdered thyme
1 tsp garlic powder
1/4 tsp salt
pinch cayenne


power pack pancakes
---------------------

The base is my home-made bannock mix that I mix up in bulk:

    - 6 cups whole wheat flour
    - 6 heaping teaspoons Magic Baking Powder
    - 1 cup lard, cut in finely into the flour so it disappears
      (requires a lot of work by hand to cut in the lard with a
      shortening cutter, but it's worth it).
    - 6 level teaspoons freeze dried egg crystals (ovaeasy)
    - 2 tablespoons brown sugar
    
STEP 2: Add the bannock mix to these ingredients to make the Power-Packed Pancake mix:

    - 3 cups bannock mix
    - 1 cup 2-minute oatmeal
    - 1/2 cup flax flour
    - 1/2 cup hemp hearts
    - 1/2 cup bran buds.
    
The pancake mix is infinitely variable depending on your tastes and what
ingredients you have on hand. You can add more oatmeal to the flour ratio, but
that will make it more crumbly. I am experimenting with adding corn starch to
make it less crumbly, because more oatmeal makes the pancakes better IMO, but
I am still experimenting. experimenting
