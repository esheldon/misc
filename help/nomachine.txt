See section on nomachine 5 https://www.racf.bnl.gov/docs/services/nx


ssh -L 7025:nx01.rcf.bnl.gov:22 rssh01.rhic.bnl.gov

then start the nomachine client

in the first time, do new connection localhost, ssh and give
the port above (e.g. 7025) 

# nomachine does not check the keyboard using the standard
# way, so our solution in xsession doesn't work. Run this

setxkbmap -option ctrl:swapcaps
