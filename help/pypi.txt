For new pypi you must use

    python setup.py sdist
    twine upload dist/*

so you need to pip install twine

- This works for esutil but I have not converted other projects.
- You need a Manifest.in to get the headers to be copied
- had to remove install_requires=['numpy'] to avoid pip
  installing new numpy, even though numpy was already available



I currently just make sure the setup.py has the right metadata and then do
    python setup.py register.

Then go to pypi and upload the file.  You can automate it with

    python setup.py sdist upload

But sdist won't put everything in there.  Apparently I can write a MANIFEST.in
that will specify everything that needs to go in.

For a new release, just update the metadata and repeat above.
