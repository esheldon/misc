D                G      D       A              D      [Bass run]
 If you see her, say hello, she might be in Tangier
D                   G     D                          C  . . . A
 She left here last early spring, is livin' there, I hear
Bm               G        D                              G
 Say for me that I'm all right though things get kind of slow
          Bm                 D/a               G                  D
She might think that I've forgotten her, don't tell her it isn't so.


D         G        D        A             D      [Bass run]
 We had a falling-out, like lovers often will
D                        G         D                           C  . . . A
 And to think of how she left that night, it still brings me a chill
Bm                 G    D                         G
 And though our separation, it pierced me to the heart
Bm                 D/a        G                  D
She still lives inside of me, we've never been apart.


D             G       D   A                  D      [Bass run]
 If you get close to her, kiss her once for me
D                  G      D                                      C  . . . A
 I always have respected her for doin' what she did and gettin' free
Bm                      G  D                        G
 Oh, whatever makes her happy, I won't stand in the way.
        Bm                   D/a                 G                           D
Oh, the bitter taste still lingers on, from that night I tried to make her stay.


D               G  D   A               D      [Bass run]
 I see a lot of people as I make the rounds
D                    G         D                         C  . . . A
 And I hear her name here and there as I go from town to town
Bm                     G        D                                G
 And I've never gotten used to it, I've just learned to turn it off
Bm                D/a       G                 D
Either I'm too sensitive or else I'm gettin' soft.


D         G        D    A                  D      [Bass run]
 Sundown,  yellow moon, I replay the past
D             G          D                         C  . . . A
 I know every scene by heart, they all went by so fast
Bm                 G         D                        G
 If she's passin' back this way, I'm not that hard to find
Bm                 D/a      G                 D
Tell her she can look me up if she's got the time.
